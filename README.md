**Storyline** 

In the distant past, the Nine Heavens Continent was once ruled by celestial beings, where mortals, demons, and deities coexisted. However, a great calamity known as the Void Cataclysm shattered the balance, scattering the divine relics and sealing away the ancient deities. Now, as a young cultivator with a mysterious past, you awaken in a remote sect with only fragmented memories. The path ahead is treacherous, filled with rival sects, forgotten legacies, and divine trials. Will you rise above the heavens, uncover the secrets of the past, and forge your destiny?

## Key Features

### **Add early game introduction**
Betrayed by your fianc√©e and cast into the abyss, you awaken amidst the darkness of a bottomless ravine. As pain courses through your body, fragments of the past resurface‚Äîthe once blissful days of love, trust, and shared dreams now reduced to bitter memories. Yet, in the depths of despair, a new fate awaits. Will you succumb to resentment, rise anew with unwavering resolve, or tread a path beyond mortal understanding? Your journey begins from the ruins of your former self, where only the strongest can defy destiny.
